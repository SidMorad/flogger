<h2>Going to the mountain(or hiking)</h2>

                                                                           <br>
 Note: this is not a guide for going to the mountain or hiking, this is my <br>
 personal experaince of trying it(and I am writing it for my future        <br>
 attempts).                                                                <br>

<h4>You may need similar things</h4>
   I left home about 7am and I had these things in my bag: buttle of water <br>
 unberlla, bread and cheese, tempature sensor, mp3 player and pocket       <br>
 tissues puls a good hat (mine is made in Germany). 
 Plus two apple, a kinfe and small pice of blanket for sun protection.     <br>
 I wake up about 6am, first drink about 1 liter water, after about 20      <br>
 minutes then having breakfast.                                            <br>

<h4>Location</h4>
   I went to closest mountain near to my place, one feautre I was looking  <br>
 for was the mountain that is big and far enought from (noise of) city.    <br>
 Another thing that was encourging me was finding an spot that is hard to  <br>
 by others.                                                                <br>

<h4>What was good about it</h4>
   Well I haven't feel that much good since I backed home from my last     <br>
 travel. I remember I was sitting in wide area between two mountains and   <br>
 it was great to be far from all dependencies. I though about the movie    <br>
 that tom hangs played, He was stuck in an island in the middle of ocean   <br>
 no one to communicate expect a ball and no technology to help him to      <br>
 servive expect his hands and his brain.                                   <br>
 Finally he made a boat and left that Island in hope of finding people.    <br>
 Personally I like that sence of the movie that he was sitting in his car  <br>
 driving in the road<!--(in the USA)--> after geting out of that island.   <br>
 I saw a map and couple of buttle of water in his car (feeling good free). <br>

<h4>Feeling good and tired and being home</h4>
   I backed home about 7 pm, first I drink three glass of milk then had a  <br>
 shower, It took about 7 minutes to wash my hair and body and about 2      <br>
 minutes having cold shower. Cold shower makes me fresh and that is why I  <br>
 am able to write about my hard day after that 2 minutes.                  <br>

<h4>Added on May 25</h4>
   This time took me 4 minutes to wash my hair and body and 1 minutes cold <br>
 shower. The difference by last time was, this time I count my hands       <br>
 movements. But this is not only thing to share with you(talking to myself)<br>
 You don't need fitness prepration for this type of sport. You may sitting <br>
 in your chair for a long time, standup, pack your bag and remmember slow  <br>
 down when you start breading fast. Slow down when you start creating alot <br>
 of noise when you walking.
