                                                                             <br>
Note: this is not a guide for going to the mountain or hiking, this is my    <br>
personal experaince of trying it(and I am writing it for my future attempts).<br>

<h4>You may need similar things</h4>
  I left home about 7am and I had these things in my bag: buttle of water    <br>
unberlla, bread and cheese, tempature sensor, mp3 player and pocket tissues. <br>
Plus two apple, a kinfe and small pice of blanket(+hat) for sun protection.  <br>
I wake up about 6am, first drink about 1 liter water, after about 20 minutes <br>
then having breakfast.                                                       <br>

<h4>Location</h4>
  I went to closest mountain near to my place, one feautre I was looking for <br>
was the mountain that is big and far enought from (noise of) city.           <br>
Another thing that was encourging me was finding an spot that is hard to rich<br>
by others.                                                                   <br>

<h4>What was good about it</h4>
  Well I haven't feel that much good since I backed home from my last travel.<br>
I remember I was sitting in wide area between two mountains and it was great <br>
to be far from all dependencies. I though about the movie that Tom Hangs     <br>
played, He was stuck in an Island in the middle of ocean, no one to comminuc-<br>
ate expect a ball and no technology to help him to servive expect his hands  <br>
and his brain.                                                               <br>
Finally he made a boat and left that Island in hope of finding people again. <br>
Personally I like that sence of the movie that he was sitting in his car dri-<br>
ving in the road<!--(in the USA)--> after geting out of that Island.         <br>
I saw a map and couple of buttle of water in his car.                        <br>

<h4>Feeling good and tired and being home</h4>
I backed home about 7pm, first I drink three glass of milk then had a shower <br>
It took about 7 minutes to wash my hair and body and about 2 minutes having  <br>
cold shower. Cold shower makes me fresh and that is why I am writing about   <br>
my hard day after that 2 minutes.                                            <br>
