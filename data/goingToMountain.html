                                                                        <br/>
 Note: this is not a guide for going to the mountain or hiking, this is <br/>
 my personal experaince of trying it(and I am writing it for my future  <br/>
 attempts).                                                             <br/>

<h4>You may need similar things</h4>
  <p>
   I left home about 7am and I had these things in my bag: buttle of    <br/>
 water, unberlla, bread and cheese, tempature sensor, mp3 player and    <br/>
 pocket tissues puls a good hat (mine is made in Germany).              <br/>
 Plus two apple, a kinfe and small pice of blanket for sun protection.  <br/>
 I wake up about 6am, first drank about 1 liter water, after about 20   <br/>
 minutes then having breakfast.                                         <br/>
  </p>
<h4>Location</h4>
  <p>
   I went to closest mountain near to my place, one feautre I was       <br/>
 looking for was the mountain that is big and far enough from          <br/>
 (noise of) city. Another thing that was encourging me was finding an   <br/>
 spot that is hard to rich by others.                                   <br/>
  </p>

<h4>What was good about it</h4>
  <p>
   Well I haven't feel that much good since I backed home from my last  <br/>
 travel. I remember I was sitting in wide area between two mountains and<br/>
 it was great to be far from all dependencies. I though about the movie <br/>
 that Tom Hanks played, He was stuck in an island in the middle of ocean<br/>
 no one to communicate except a ball and no technology to help him to   <br/>
 servive except his hands and his brain.                                <br/>
 Finally he made a boat and left that island in hope of finding people. <br/>
 Personally I like that scene of the movie that he was sitting in       <br/>
 his car driving in the road<!--(in the USA)--> after getting out of    <br/>
 that island. I saw a map and couple of buttle of water in his car      <br/>
 (feeling good free).                                                   <br/>
  </p>

<h4>Feeling good and tired and being home</h4>
  <p>
   I backed home about 7 pm, first I drink three glass of milk then had <br/>
 a shower, It took about 7 minutes to wash my hair and body and about 2 <br/>
 minutes having cold shower. Cold shower makes me fresh and that is why <br/>
 I am able to write about my hard day after that 2 minutes.             <br/>
  </p>
<h4>Added on May 25</h4>
  <p>
   This time took me 4 minutes to wash my hair and body and 1 minute    <br/>
  cold shower. The difference by last time was, this time I count my    <br/>
  hands movements. But this is not only thing to share with you         <br/>
 (talking to myself) You don't need fitness prepration for this type of <br/>
 sport. You may sitting in your chair for a long time, start by packing <br/>
 your bag and remmember: Slow down when you start breading fast. Slow   <br/>
 down when you start creating a lot of noise when you walking.          <br/>

   Forget about all things I told you before, Buy a book named          <br/>
 <i>Mountaineering: Freedom of the Hills</i>. (And read it with joy)    <br/>
 I've read some parts and I know now, for example there are 10 items    <br/>
 very good to carry before goingToMountain. I've written them down with <br/>
 following format:                                                      <br/>

 3.Extra Clothing                                                       <br/>
