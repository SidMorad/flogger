  <body>


Note: this is not a guide for going to the mountain or hiking, this is my    <br>
personal experaince of trying it(and I am writing it for my future attempts).<br>


<h2>You may need similar things</h2>
I left home about 7am and I had these things in my bag: buttle of water,a hat<br>
unberlla, bread and cheese, tempature sensor, mp3 player and pocket tissues. <br>
Plus two apple, a kinfe and small pice of blanket for sun protection.        <br>
I wake up about 6am, first drink about 1 liter water, after about 20 minutes <br>
then having breakfast.                                                       <br>

<h2>Location</h2>
I went to closest mountain near my place, one feautre I was looking for was  <br>
the mountain that is big and far enought from (noise of) city.               <br>
Another thing that was encourging me was finding an spot that is hard to rich<br>
by others.                                                                   <br>

<h2>What was good about it</h2>
Well I haven't feel that much freedom since I backed home(+3:30 GMT) from +10<br>
GMT.I remember I was sitting in wide area between two mountain and it was gr-<br>
eat to be far from all dependencies. I though about the movie that Tom Hangs <br>
played, He was stuck in an Island in the middle of ocean, no one to comminuc-<br>
ate expect a ball and no technology to help him to servive expect his hands  <br>
and his brain.                                                               <br>
Finally he made a boat and left that Island in hope of finding people again. <br>
Personally I like that sence of the movie that he was sitting in his car dri-<br>
ving in the road<!--(USA)--> after geting out of that Island.                <br>
I saw a map and couple of buttle of water in his car.                        <br>

<h2>Cheese lid</h2>
I was sitting in that wide area and there was no time pressure at all. It was<br>
about 1pm that I've dicide to have lunch. my lunch was very simple, bread and<br>
cheese. I bought my cheese from a shop near our apartment. It was something  <br>
wrong about it, it was it's lid. I don't know how much time I spend to open  <br>
it correctly. By saying correclty I mean finding a way to open it then having<br>
the possiblity of closing it for later use. All four side were the same and  <br>
no sign of open it from here was there. I tried all four side and I failed to<br>
open it correctly.                                                           <br>
This remind me of a memory that I had in +10 GMT, I was in a place that we   <br>
had only 30 minutes time for our lunch. And there were some food container in<br>
black color and with plastic lid. Some times those lid were easy to open and <br>
sometimes not.                                                               <br>

<h2>Feeling good and tired and being home</h2>
I backed home about 7pm, first I drink three glass of milk then had a shower <br>
It took about 7 minutes to wash my hair and body and about 2 minutes having  <br>
cold shower. Cold shower makes me fresh and that is why I am writing about   <br>
my hard day after that 2 minutes.                                            <br>
