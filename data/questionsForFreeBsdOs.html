<h1>questionsForFreeBsdOs</h1>
<p>
   During my experiance with FreeBSD operating system, there were some   <br/>
 questions that I was wishing someone could answer to me. Since these    <br/>
 questions are kind of wired, I've decided to only write them down here. <br/>
 Moreover I think FreeBSD document porject is great, and if I find       <br/>
 answers of these questions, then they will be available here.           <br/>
 (FreeBSD-9.0 was my testing environment)                                <br/>

 Why default shell for normal users is sh ?                              <br/>
 (While default shell for root user is csh)                              <br/>
                                                                         <br/>
 Why sh shell doesn't recognize .logout file ?                           <br/>
 (While csh it does   recognize .logout file)                            <br/>
                                                                         <br/>
