  If someone tell you pack your bag, we are going to start this next
software project. What do you put in your backpack? In this post I am going
to talk about my personal choices and also guide my-past-myself! to
fast forward to today.
</p>

<p>
  First thing I put in my backpack is a book, named 'Domain-Driven Design:
Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software', written by Eric Evans.
I think I love and hate this book equally. I love it because it did answer
many of my long-running questions. I hate it because I don't read
technical books anymore as much as I used to.
</p>

<p>
  Questions like: what should I name this function/method in this object/class?
According to DDD(Domain-Driven Design) names should come out of a ubiquitous
language, shaped by all people in project and especially Domain Experts.
Therefore a new developer can gain domain knowledge by reading source code.
How cool is that and I wish I knew this eariler.
</p>

<p>
  I think this book is timeless, and can be useful for creating any long
lasting software which is fun to extend and maintian. Isolating doamin
complexity in a layer and making this layer indepedent from other layers is a
great idea. Personally I like the fact that Domain models are plain objects
which this make it possible to write thousands of unit-test by total
execution time as low as 2 seconds.
</p>

<p>
  Second thing I put in my backpack is my ebook-reader. I do have almost all
books wrriten by Martin Fowler in it, plus his signature series. What Martin
Fowler is doing through his books and his website is amazing. I havn't seen
nobody better than him in documenting his valuable experiances. My favourite
book of him is 'Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code'. I also
have books from other amazing authors such as Kent Beck. 'Test-Driven
Development By Example' is one of his must read books.
</p>

<p>
  Last things I put in my backpack is a bottle of water, an extra light/warm
cloths, some fruits, a pencil and a notebook. that's all.
