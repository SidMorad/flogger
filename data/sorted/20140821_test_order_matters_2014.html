   Sould we care about tests order, or should we leave this     <br />
 responsibility to a computer(e.g. default order base on test   <br />
 name and test filename (0-9A-Za-z)). I think in real life      <br />
 we care about doing things in order, For example I usually     <br />
 wake up in morning, then I drink two glass of water, and one   <br />
 glass of milk. then I make tea(or coffee) and prepare bread for<br />
 breakfast.                                                     <br />
 I eat my breakfast slowly and review my last night, if it was  <br />
 strange night, I pick less work for current day. However I care<br />
 about going to WC and take shower after that anyway.           <br />
</p>
<p>
 Sometimes, I make mistakes in doing things in order,           <br />
 For example I drink milk first then I drink water, which is not<br />
 big deal, but my plan usually is like drink water first then   <br />
 drink milk(between tea prepration time). Or in worse case      <br />
 scenario I took shower then I feel need for going to WC(toilet)<br />
 and have a big one!. Which we all know reverse order is better <br />
 order in this specific scenario.                               <br />

 Backing to test order matters in computer software world,      <br />
 basically, any time that a computer may knows something and you<br />
 don't, then it may be surprises down there, watch out.         <br />
 As I speak, there is no famous test framework around for       <br />
 supporting this feature. I was thinking about this quite some  <br />
 times. I even wrote simple sample that is able to run tests    <br />
 in all possible orders, see https://github.com/smoradi/runit   <br />
 but still not close to what it is good to have.                <br />

 Update 2016 Feb 19: It seems we could have tests in alphabet   <br />
 order (Java - JUnit - Maven - Surefire! plugin) Thank you.     <br />
