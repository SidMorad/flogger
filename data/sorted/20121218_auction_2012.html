<h2>auction2012</h2>
<p>
   'auction' was a name we picked for a project done in 2012.   <br />
 End result was a website for insurance companies to offer their<br />
 insurance policies to the public. This text is going to talk   <br />
 about software development activies done during this project   <br />
 lifetime(from July 2012 to December 2012).                     <br />
</p>
<p>
 I was wondering how world would be like for software in 4012.  <br />
 It will be really hard to imagine. But let say, we still need  <br />
 programmers to solve some problems. Their day could be quite   <br />
 different than mine. But let say, one of them may go for       <br />
 a morning walk and during that walk, he thinks about what story<br />
 could be solved today. Probably there are some different tools <br />
 and devices there that may works better than our current tools.<br />
 For instance, I wish you have a better device than computers   <br />
 with simple and accurate tools. Let's say simple programmerable<br />
 device that could calculate 2 + 2 = 4 with fixed execution     <br />
 elapsed time and always correct result(regardless of your mode <br />
 or having a bad weather!).                                     <br />
</p>
<p>
 I found reading technical books while working as a great habit.<br />
 Sometimes it may seems to slow you down, but in long run you   <br />
 feels their advantages. Second useful thing for me is to see   <br />
 a working example. About working example, I don't recommend to <br />
 use copy command, but what I think is better to do is rewrite. <br />
</p>
<p>
 We start with writing our first test-case, It was as simple as <br />
 Load application context and check if test environment is OK.  <br />
 To gave you more implementation details, my team decided to go <br />
 with Java programming language. Maven build tool was chosen for<br />
 building and executing test-cases. I remember initial execution<br />
 elapsed time was about 10 seconds. Loading database connection <br />
 was included in this time, which usually such external         <br />
 resources are resoan for delays and increasing elapsed time.   <br />
 Using Stubs, Mocks, TestDouble etc is recommended by some      <br />
 respectable people in such situation, but personally I found   <br />
 testing a 'real code' it gave me better confident and it is    <br />
 simpler and easier to write for me. At the same time it is     <br />
 possible to maintain a fast test-suite under one minute time   <br />
 with this method(which is a fair elapsed time(or not?)).       <br />
</p>
<p>
 A meaningful test data could contribute to team communication  <br />
 and speed up manual testing by developers. First what I mean   <br />
 with 'meaningful test data' is a test-data that are good match <br />
 to domain area, and domain experts are who you could get help  <br />
 when you need to. These test-data could get mature by passing  <br />
 development time. For example to test many business logic in   <br />
 auction2012 we need at least a consumer, a company and         <br />
 an auction. Let's call our consumer Jo, company Sharp and      <br />
 auction year12. Then you may have a business story such as     <br />
 created policy by a company should be visiable to consumers    <br />
 after it's auction is open to the public. Now question is      <br />
 how many rows of data you need in your tables to make sure your<br />
 code works OK in this scenario? the point is the less record   <br />
 you need to insert, the more mature is your test-data.         <br />
</p>
<p>
 Warning: these test-data should not be modified by any test!   <br />
 In my time JUnit testing framework could not execute tests in  <br />
 order. Instead it recommends to make each test quite           <br />
 independent from other tests(which seems a good thing).        <br />
 The danger of not having ordered suite is, other computers may <br />
 be able to find a way to break one or more tests, but you don't<br />
 know it yet!. This test-data will also contribute to team      <br />
 communication, for example if you want to see all consumer     <br />
 features, then Jo consumer user could be used. and if something<br />
 is not working for Jo and Sharp company in auction year12,     <br />
 then it will be easy for developers to reproduce it in their   <br />
 local machines. I am planning to read a book named [xUnit Test <br />
 Patterns: Refactoring Test Code by Gerard Meszaros] to learn   <br />
 more about refactoring test code.                              <br />
</p>
<p>
 Before starting this project, I was reading book [Domain-      <br />
 Specific Languages by Martin Fowler], and when project was     <br />
 started, I was looking for a part in requirements that new DSL <br />
 language could be suitable. I haven't find any part and reading <br />
 this book stopped. Another book that my reading was interrupted<br />
 was [Fit for Developing Software: Framework for Integrated     <br />
 Tests by Rick Mugridge and Ward Cunningham]. I did recommend   <br />
 FIT to my team but we end up with let's give it a try in       <br />
 another project. [Patterns of Enterprise Application by Martin <br />
 Fowler] was a book that I finished during this project time.   <br />
 I highly recommend this book to anyone that is working on      <br />
 Enterprise Applications.                                       <br />
</p>
<p>
 Martin Fowler and his teammates at ThoughtWorks.com are great  <br />
 source of software development advises. Technology Radar[1] is <br />
 a great document worth to follow. It was inside of one of these<br />
 radars that I saw term, Evolutionary Database. after a little  <br />
 bit search in the web, I found a book named [Recipes for       <br />
 Continuous Database Integration, Evolutionay Database          <br />
 Developement by Paramod Sadalage]. Being familar with SQL and  <br />
 relational databases helped me to get the idea very fast.      <br />
 automated SQL scripts are great for maintaining and modifying  <br />
 database schema. Personally I like the fact that these         <br />
 techniques will make it possible to design and refactor        <br />
 database schema along with design and refactor any part of the <br />
 code.                                                          <br />
</p>
<p>
 To finish my book list, [Implementation Patterns by Kent Beck] <br />
 and [Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Relesases through  <br />
 Build, Test and Deployment Automation By Jez Humble and David  <br />
 Farley], were last two books. Implementation patterns was      <br />
 enjoyable read from start to the end. Continuous Devlivery was <br />
 enjoyable read too but because of time limit, I picked         <br />
 specific chapters that were helping us in my current project.  <br />
 Inside of this book there is one sentence that says: deploying <br />
 to the production server should be as easy as pushing a button!<br />
 We didn't went that far in auction project, but I am proud to  <br />
 say deploying to the production for us was as easy as passing  <br />
 target version to deploy script (e.g. deploy.sh 1.0-SNAPSHOT). <br />
</p>
<p>
 Now let's talk about stealing from working examples.           <br />
 AppFuse.org is one of my favorite project, it is always fun to <br />
 follow it's development in dev and user mailing list.          <br />
 Recently they release version 2.2.1 which was a great news.    <br />
 A big thank you to Matt Raible and AppFuse team for AppFuse!   <br />
 I also manage to recieve updates and improvement directly from <br />
 their new fine GitHub repository[2]. Building from source code <br />
 was a little bit difficult(Maven will download lot's of jars!) <br />
 and I didn't have local mail server (which force me to @Ignore <br />
 email related tests). AppFuse(2.2.1) now use better maven      <br />
 plugin(org.codehaus.mojo:webtest-maven-plugin:1.0.0) for       <br />
 integration-test phase. And that was a part we benefit in      <br />
 auction2012 project too.                                       <br />
 (Note: I have to add net.sourceforge.htmlunit:hmtlunit:2.9     <br />
 as plugin dependency to webtest-maven-plugin for having better <br />
 JavaScript support(e.g. jQuery blockUI works in this version)) <br />
</p>
<p>
  Spring-Roo was another great working example for us. It was   <br />
 amazing how fast is possible to create project structure with  <br />
 full set of features. To gave you one example, during this     <br />
 project lifetime, one of good friend of mine, asked me to do   <br />
 a webinar for Spring-Roo. So I did this webinar with providing <br />
 a working example built by Spring-Roo. This web application was<br />
 a tool for recording your exercise records[3]. GitHub shows    <br />
 26 August as starting development day and last commit was sent <br />
 31 August 2012.                                                <br />
 One of features in this web application is ability to export   <br />
 your records to PDF or Excel formats. This feature added with  <br />
 one of Spring-Roo add-ons named Jasperoo. I manage to add this <br />
 feature as single commit[4]. Later I've used this commit to    <br />
 add this export feature to auction2012 project.                <br />
 Spring-Roo use Spring-MVC as default technology for view layer.<br />
 We did use Spring-MVC in auction2012 and we benefit from JSP   <br />
 tagx files provided by Spring-Roo.                             <br />
</p>
<p>
 It was a time, we were in production stage, and that was the   <br />
 time I saw the real value of integration-tests (Include GUI    <br />
 acceptance testing). It was working great as safety net!       <br />
 I do not recommend to use a test recorder for creating them.   <br />
 Instead I do recommend to pick testing area wisely, then write <br />
 and maintain them manually. For example 'consumer registration <br />
 page' has high business value for our product owner, therefore <br />
 we need to make sure any released version of application       <br />
 will perform correctly in consumer registration process.       <br />
 And it may be interesting to mention, later we had copule of   <br />
 change requests in consumer registration story, which we were  <br />
 successful to deliver them fast and with high confident.       <br />
</p>
<p>
 I've used Eclipse IDE editor for editing texts(source code).   <br />
 By passing the time, I notice I do not want Eclipse to compile <br />
 my source code(compile and run from console was better         <br />
 experiance).In continue I notice I do not want any of auto     <br />
 features, including Auto update, Auto build, Auto refresh, etc.<br />
 Then I found what I really need is a very simple editor(not    <br />
 Eclipse!). An editor with highlight keywords feature and       <br />
 without network featuers!. If you are going to make one, please<br />
 make it isolated from all other existing things. Display texts <br />
 in monitor and save texts in a file are simple wanted features.<br />
 Especially don't make it to be able send logs to a remote      <br />
 computer, or a remote person use it to edit remote files.      <br />
</p>

 FreeBSD operating system and sweet home!                       <br />
 Looking at the past one of my best decisions was migrating from<br />
 Ubuntu operating system to FreeBSD operating system.           <br />
 In short  my level of peace of mind increased by this change.  <br />
 Around 27 May 2012 this migration happend according to my      <br />
 config project[5] at GitHub. Config project includes my        <br />
 day-to-day configurations after this migration. I did document <br />
 these configurations in a case someone(probebly me again) need <br />
 them.                                                          <br />
</p>
<p>
 Moving from work in office to work from home was another       <br />
 great decision for me. Coding from home has many advantages,   <br />
 Between them, dirinking lots of water and going to my personal <br />
 badroom anytime I want to, is my favorite one!                 <br />
 Sometimes it may get hard to track little important thing while<br />
 you do hard programming. For example did you eat enough fruits <br />
 today? or it was yesterday? If you are not sure, that is a time<br />
 you need to write them down(in my opinoin). In my case my mom  <br />
 was looking after these things, which was a great contribution <br />
 to project productivity and my health.                         <br />

 Amazon kindle ebook reader has changed my world of reading     <br />
 experiance. I bought my kindle around July 2011, while my study<br />
 was near to finish at Southern Cross University. Thanks to my  <br />
 parents for their great support during my study, which without <br />
 their support none of my achievements was possible today.      <br />
 I wish everyone in the world a device similar to Amazon Kindle.<br />
 Imagine when you are going to be born, someone will give you a <br />
 similar device and tell you welcome to our world, this is your <br />
 ebook reader, read as much as you like, go ahead and make      <br />
 things, we will support you!                                   <br />
</p>
<p>
 What I am going to do next? is not much clear at this moment,  <br />
 My Visa credit card will expire in March 2013, which is        <br />
 kind of worry for me for not being able to buy my favorite     <br />
 technical books after this time. I would love to travel to any <br />
 part of the world that people does not have such worries.      <br />
 Working in a company like ThoughtWorks would be great also[7]. <br />
 Picking a hard problem and solving it for lots of people is a  <br />
 very fun thing to do also.                                     <br />
 About starting a startup company, I found nobody better than   <br />
 Paul Graham[6] as best source of advises.                      <br />
 My income of auction2012 is enough for me to survive at least  <br />
 a year without working for anyone. If you are interested to    <br />
 know what I am going to do next, watch my twitter account      <br />

[7] ThoughtWorks is especial company, you could see it from type<br />
    of people they already have. I really like to work there one<br />
    day. I expect to learn lots of interesting things there and <br />
    at the same time to be able share them with outside world.  <br />
    Which it seems they are very open to it.                    <br />
    I am a little bit lazy to go for applying process,          <br />
    Maybe I just wait until they contact me :-)                 <br />
