 Imagine a city designed by programmers, what you want to be there?
 I want a city without any cars! bicycles are fine although.
 You could walk and think freely, without any worries of having accident
 with cars. You have to go for shopping nearly every day, because you have
 to carry them by your foot. I know programmers are lazy and we like to
 spend less time in repeated works. But look at it like an exercise that
 if you don't do it, you end up being hungry for that day.

 Lock free city, Imagine there is no need to lock things, for example you
 go out with your bicycle and you leave it anywhere you want unlocked. and
 in worst case scenario, you will back and there is no bicycle. I like to
 think that bicycle is now with someone who needs it more than me. and I will
 buy another inexpensive bicycle. I like to think that I am contributing to
 my city by providing bicycles for who needs it more than me.
 and in return I enjoy the feeling of not carying a key.

 Open the city, Imagine there is no secrets in the city, every one has a
 right to know every things about the city. Similar to open source software
 that programmers could read and understand and improve. People in the city
 should have a right to know and understand and improve things. As matter of
 fact this is the programmers city, programmers are the core, they could
 solve almost any thing that they care about. Their priority may suprise us
 some times, but let's hope Freedom of speech is in the top of their list.

 Move the city, Imagine the city is easy to move, and we could move it with
 season changes. Remember programmers made the city in first place and they
 could come up with ideas that make this possible. I also like to see they
 make this possible in middle of desert or hard to live places.
 Let's practice resource managements for traveling across universe.
