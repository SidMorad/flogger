give thinkers enough time to think
They are many types of people in the world, let's talk about thinkers here.
Thinkers have many skills, let's talk about their problem solving skill here.
Give a thinker a problem, he or she needs some time to gave you an solution.

They also may need special environment to think clearly, for example a quite
place. Depends to size of problem, their thinking time may exceed to days or
weeks or more. My question is what your society provides for them? could they
walk in the street and think freely. How they react to see someone is
thinking? do they create a noise or disruption? or they admire and walk away?

Successful societies are giving their thinkers enough time to think. They knew
future of their society depends to quality of solutions provided by thinkers.
And please be honest with thinkers, starting with correct information helps.
Otherwise will cause to activate truth finder process on background.
