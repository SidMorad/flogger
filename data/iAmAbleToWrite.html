<p>
I haven't wrote for couple of days, this remind me of not been able to     <br/>
write for couple of years. To be honest I panic a litte bit first, then I  <br/>
thought why this happend to me? or better question was what if that happen <br/>
again?                                                                     <br/>

<h4>Spring season, Good internet connection and Freedom </h4>
<p>
  One of the reason that I am able to write, right now, it could be spring <br/>
season. Spring season is next to the winter season (abviosly) and it seems <br/>
by changing the environment, people change too     (abviosly).             <br/>
I don't know how internet connection is connected to my mode of writing.   <br/>
What I know is if I am not in a good mode of writing then there is high    <br/>
chance of not having a good internet connection too.                       <br/>
Freedom has levels (I think) and by writing something you could change    <br/>
that level of freedom for yourself and/or for others.                      <br/>
Well you may know why you (talking to myself) are able to write, right now.<br/>
</p>
<h4>Writing for myself</h4>
<p>
  I am writing things down for myself. I founded it  useful when I have a  <br/>
repeated task. For example once I wrote a post in my blog about using some <br/>
software program in my current project. Later on I back to that post to use<br/>
it for another project. Simply I was not able to remmeber required steps.  <br/>
Another advantage for me is, it shows some of my thinking about particular <br/>
subject. And when I am backing to that subject in my future way then I     <br/>
could use those forgotton points.                                          <br/>
</p>
<h4>Is our mind a safe place for our thinking? </h4>
<p>
  We don't know about full potential of a brain. Some day maybe not far    <br/>
we may find a way to use more of this potentail. Until that day I will use <br/>
computer hard drive as an safe place to leave my thinking for my future    <br/>
access.                                                                    <br/>
</p>
<h4>Are you a software programmer?</h4>
<p>
  Not being able to write code will give me stronger panic. To give you an <br/>
advise (talking to myself) since you are thinking about making a good      <br/>
software, then you will be fine.                                           <br/>
</p>
<h4>So what if that happen again?</h4>
<p>
  You will be fine since you are able to write code (making things).
