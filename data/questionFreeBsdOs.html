  </head>

   During my experiance with FreeBSD operating system, there were some     <br>
 questions that I was wishing someone could answer to me. Since I          <br>
 don't have enough time to find right person or asking them from           <br>
 mailing list, so I've decided to only write them down here.                <br>
 Noteless I think FreeBSD document porject is great,                       <br>
 If I found answers of these questions, then                               <br>
 result will be available here.                                            <br>
 (FreeBSD-9.0 was my testing environment)                                  <br>
                                                                     &nbsp;<br>
 FreeBSD logo, why they pick this one ?                                    <br>
                                                                     &nbsp;<br>
 Why default shell for normal users is sh ?                                <br>
 (While default shell for root user is csh)                                <br>
                                                                     &nbsp;<br>
 Why sh shell doesn't recognize .logout file ?                             <br>
 (While csh it does   recognize .logout file)                              <br>
                                                                     &nbsp;<br>
