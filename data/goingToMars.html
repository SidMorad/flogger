<h4>What we need</h4>
<p>
   All we need are people. Simply we need some people to wake up at the  <br/>
 morning and first thing they think about is Mars mission.               <br/>

<h4>Magnets Energy</h4>
<p>
  Magnets Energy may works like attractions energy. Instead of seeing people
 flying in spacecraft, why we don't have clothes with enough magnets energy
 that enable people to walk similar to way they walk in earth. I've heard
 people's digesting system not working as it works in earth, maybe we could
 use magnets energy for this problem too, mixing some amount with our foods.
 I am writing this down in case maybe someone examin it in equipped lab.
