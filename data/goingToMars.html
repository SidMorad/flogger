<h4>What we need</h4>
   All we need is people. Simply we need some people to wake up at the     <br>
 morning and first thing they think is about Mars mission.                 <br>

<h4>New planet, new everthings</h4>
   This new planet colud be a fresh start for people. We could use some of <br>
 good practices of the planet Earth to build a better base for getting to  <br>
 otherside of universe.                                                    <br>

<h4>Random Questions</h4>
   Do we have more than one country? Do we have Internet available similar <br>
 Earth? Do we have immigration rules? Do we have freedom of speach?        <br>
 Do we have human rights?                                                  <br>
 Do we have oxygen in the air? Do we have water in pipes? Do we have type  <br>
 of foods that we eat here in Earth? Do we have enough electricity energy? <br>
 Do we have other type of energies?                                        <br>

<h4>Random Solutions</h4>
   Sending first group of people that wants to go to Mars and die there.   <br>
 It may sounds hard to find this type of people, but I want to be one of   <br>
 them. I am curious to know if nothings could servive in Mars then what    <br>
 will happen to my dead body?                                              <br>
 we never know if we don't try it! yes!                                    <br>
