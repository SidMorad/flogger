<h4>What we need</h4>
<p>
   All we need are people. Simply we need some people to wake up at the  <br/>
 morning and first thing they think about is Mars mission.               <br/>
</p>
<h4>Magnets Energy</h4>
<p>
  Magnet Energy may works like attraction energy. Instead of seeing people
 flying in spacecraft, why we don't have clothes with enough magnets energy
 that enable people to walk similar to way they walk in earth.
 I am writing this down in case it may be useful.
